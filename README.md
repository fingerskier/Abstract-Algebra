# Abstract-Algebra
Explorations of abstract algebra through coding

## Syllabus

---

1. Groups

Concepts:

Definitions: Group, Subgroup, Cyclic Group

Group operations: Closure, Associativity, Identity, Inverses

Symmetry Groups (e.g., rotations of a polygon)


Programming Projects:

Implement group operations for integers under addition or multiplication modulo .

Simulate symmetry groups using matrices for transformations.

Visualize the Cayley table for small groups.



---

2. Rings and Fields

Concepts:

Rings: Addition and Multiplication, Commutative Rings, Unity

Fields: Division, Finite Fields (Galois fields)

Polynomial Rings


Programming Projects:

Build modular arithmetic for finite fields and demonstrate its use in cryptography (e.g., RSA).

Create a polynomial arithmetic library and explore roots and irreducibility.



---

3. Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms

Concepts:

Homomorphism: Structure-preserving maps between groups.

Kernel and Image.

Isomorphism: Structural equivalence.


Programming Projects:

Implement functions to test if two groups are isomorphic.

Visualize the kernel and image of a homomorphism.



---

4. Vector Spaces and Modules

Concepts:

Basis, Linear Independence.

Inner Products and Orthogonality.

Subspaces and Quotients.


Programming Projects:

Write a module for vector space operations.

Explore Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.



---

5. Advanced Topics

Topics:

Group Actions: Permutations and Orbits.

Representation Theory: Matrices over groups.

Category Theory: Morphisms and Functors.


Programming Projects:

Simulate group actions on sets and explore stabilizers.

Represent groups as matrices and compute characters.

Develop a basic framework for category theory concepts.



---

Interactive Ideas

Build a web app or desktop GUI to explore structures interactively.

Use libraries like NumPy for matrix operations or Matplotlib for visualizations.

Leverage symbolic computation tools like SymPy to handle algebraic expressions.


Would you like detailed code examples or specific libraries to use for any of these?
