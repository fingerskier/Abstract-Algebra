1. Deeper Group, Ring, and Field Theory

1. Advanced Group Theory

Focus: Classification of finite simple groups (a monumental result), group cohomology, group actions on manifolds.

Coding:

Extend your permutation-group code to handle larger S_n and explore group actions on sets or graphs.

Implement functions to test group properties (solvability, simple group checks—though that can get deep quickly).




2. Commutative Algebra

Focus: Ideal theory, modules over rings, Noetherian rings, Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz.

Why: This is the foundation of algebraic geometry and advanced number theory.

Coding:

Explore computations with Gröbner bases (a major tool for solving polynomial systems).

Implement an ideal class, algorithms for ideal operations.




3. Galois Theory

Focus: Field extensions, Galois groups, solvability of polynomials by radicals.

Coding:

Build or extend your polynomial library to handle factorization over finite fields or rationals.

Attempt to detect when a polynomial is reducible, find splitting fields, and map out the Galois group for small-degree polynomials.






---

2. Algebraic Number Theory

What It Entails: Studying rings of algebraic integers, factorization in number fields, class groups, and so on.

Why: It’s central to modern cryptography (e.g., RSA, elliptic curves) and deep theoretical results in Diophantine equations.

Coding:

Implement basic routines for prime factorization in  (Gaussian integers), or other quadratic extensions.

Experiment with small primes in algebraic extensions, verifying unique factorization (or lack thereof).




---

3. Algebraic Geometry

Focus: Geometry of solutions to polynomial equations, varieties, schemes (if you go deep).

Why: Fundamental to cutting-edge mathematics, cryptography (e.g., elliptic curves, advanced topics in zero-knowledge proofs).

Coding:

Start by coding routines to handle polynomial ideals in multiple variables.

Possibly try an introduction to projective curves (e.g., implementing the group law on elliptic curves).




---

4. Representation Theory

What It Is: How groups (or algebras) “act” on vector spaces. This unites linear algebra with group theory in a powerful way.

Use Cases: Physics (quantum mechanics), chemistry (molecular symmetry), combinatorics, coding theory.

Coding:

Represent finite groups as matrices over  or finite fields.

Implement algorithms to find irreducible representations, character tables for small groups.




---

5. Algebraic Topology

At a Glance: Studying topological spaces with algebraic tools (homology, cohomology, fundamental groups).

Why: This expands your perspective on how algebra can classify shapes and structures at a fundamental level.

Coding:

Implement a simplicial complex library, computing homology groups (e.g., via boundary matrices).

Visualize how connected components, holes, etc., appear in 2D/3D complexes.




---

6. Advanced Linear Algebra & Multilinear Algebra

Why: Essential for machine learning, quantum computing, theoretical physics, and higher-level pure math.

Possible Next Steps: Jordan canonical form, spectral theorem, tensor products, exterior algebra.

Coding:

Extend your matrix library to handle large-scale operations, symbolic manipulations (e.g., symbolic matrix inverse).

Implement algorithms for canonical forms, rank computations, eigen decompositions from scratch.




---

7. Category Theory

Core Idea: “The mathematics of mathematics” — studying objects and morphisms in a unifying framework.

Why: Offers a deep conceptual language that unifies many algebraic (and other) structures.

Coding:

Attempt a small “category” framework, representing objects and arrows as data structures, checking composition laws.

Explore “functors” between categories as transformations in code (though this can get very abstract).




---

8. Cryptography & Computational Number Theory

Why: Real-world applications that tie in group theory, finite fields, polynomial arithmetic, etc.

Possible Topics:

RSA, discrete log problem in finite groups, elliptic-curve cryptosystems.

Lattice-based cryptography (post-quantum).


Coding:

Build your own toy crypto library—implement key generation, encryption/decryption, etc.

Experiment with performance optimizations for large prime generation, polynomial operations.

Practical Tips for Further Study

1. Pick One Path: Each topic above can easily become a multi-year pursuit. Choose one or two that resonate with you—maybe you like geometry (go for algebraic geometry) or have a knack for discrete structures (representation theory).


2. Stay Hands-On: Keep coding. Even advanced topics like category theory or algebraic geometry can benefit from test-driven “toy” implementations.


3. Use Specialized Tools: For certain advanced computations (e.g., Gröbner bases, advanced factorization), you might eventually want to integrate specialized packages (e.g., SageMath, GAP, Singular) to understand how these tools are engineered.
