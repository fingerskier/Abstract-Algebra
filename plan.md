Below is a concise, forward-thinking, 12-week study program for abstract algebra (and a bit of broader advanced math) that emphasizes learning by writing your own libraries and coding everything from scratch. The schedule assumes about 1 hour of focused study per day.


---

Overview

1. Language Choice: Use a language with decent support for arbitrary-precision integers and easy object-oriented or functional abstractions. Common choices: Python, Haskell, Julia, or C++. Python is usually the simplest for quick prototyping.


2. Core Topics:

Weeks 1–4: Group Theory (structures, permutations, subgroups).

Weeks 5–8: Ring & Field Theory (polynomial arithmetic, modular arithmetic, field extensions).

Weeks 9–10: Additional Advanced Math Topics (e.g., linear algebra from scratch, special topics like Galois Theory or basic representation theory).

Weeks 11–12: Integration & Projects (tying it all together with small projects or deeper explorations).



3. Daily Breakdown (1 hour total, loosely split):

0–10 min: Theoretical reading / review notes.

10–45 min: Coding exercises to implement or illustrate the concept. (Write library modules, test them, refactor.)

45–60 min: Brief wrap-up, note-taking, advanced tasks (like exploring a proof or debugging).

Detailed Week-by-Week Plan

Weeks 1–2: Fundamentals of Group Theory

Theoretical Focus:

Definitions: sets, binary operations, groups, subgroups, cyclic groups.

Basic proofs: closure, identity, inverses, associativity.

The concept of group homomorphisms (just a preview).


Coding Goals:

Week 1: Implement a minimal “group” class/structure.

A GroupElement type or simple approach where you store the set and define the operation as a function.

Show closure, identity, and inverses in code.


Week 2: Add features:

Subgroups: a method that checks if a subset is a subgroup.

Cyclic group generator: implement Z_n (integers mod n under addition).



Daily Practice:

Day 1–3: Read about group axioms, implement Z_n.

Day 4–5: Write tests for identity, inverses.

Day 6–7: Implement subgroup checks, reflect on set membership and closure.



Weeks 3–4: Permutations & More Group Properties

Theoretical Focus:

Permutation groups: S_n, cycle notation, composition of permutations.

Homomorphisms and normal subgroups, cosets (brief intro to quotient groups).


Coding Goals:

Week 3: Implement permutations in code:

Represent permutations (e.g., as lists or cycle notation).

Write functions for composition, inversion, order of a permutation.


Week 4: Add advanced group features:

Homomorphism check: if f(g1*g2) == f(g1)*f(g2) etc.

Normal subgroup check (if you want to get a taste of advanced ops).



Daily Practice:

Day 1–3: Write a Permutation class, define composition and inverse.

Day 4–5: Build small tools: e.g. compute cycles from a permutation.

Day 6–7: Explore a normal-subgroup checking approach or attempt a small homomorphism example.



Weeks 5–6: Rings & Polynomial Arithmetic

Theoretical Focus:

Rings, integral domains, ideals.

Polynomial rings over integers or finite fields.


Coding Goals:

Week 5:

Implement an integer-based ring class (again Z_n but now for multiplication and addition).

Provide ring operations: addition, multiplication, identity elements.


Week 6:

Implement polynomials over a ring.

Write code for polynomial addition, multiplication, evaluating polynomials.

Possibly attempt polynomial GCD in your ring of choice (e.g., polynomials over integers mod p).



Daily Practice:

Day 1–2: Basic ring definitions, code ring operations.

Day 3–4: Investigate ring homomorphisms from Z onto Z_n.

Day 5–6: Implement polynomial representation (e.g., list of coefficients).

Day 7: Add polynomial multiplication, test thoroughly.



Weeks 7–8: Field Theory & Extensions

Theoretical Focus:

Fields, prime fields, construction of finite fields GF(p^n).

Possibly a brief look at field extensions (if time permits).


Coding Goals:

Week 7:

Implement a finite field GF(p) by building on your Z_n ring.

Check that every nonzero element is invertible. Write an inverse function.


Week 8:

Attempt a simple extension, e.g. GF(p)[x]/(f(x)) for an irreducible polynomial f(x).

Represent elements as polynomials mod an irreducible polynomial.



Daily Practice:

Day 1–3: Write the finite field GF(p) from your ring structure.

Day 4–5: Implement multiplicative inverse (Extended Euclidean Algorithm).

Day 6–7: Build a simple field extension structure; do minimal examples (like constructing GF(4) from GF(2)).



Weeks 9–10: Advanced Topics Sampler

Pick any one or two advanced topics to dive deeper:

1. Galois Theory:

Theoretical piece: Galois groups, fundamental theorem of Galois theory.

Coding piece: Maybe attempt to compute the Galois group of a small polynomial if feasible.



2. Linear Algebra from Scratch:

Implement your own matrix class, row-reduction, eigenvalues, etc.

This might cross over into ring theory if you do everything in a general ring.



3. Representation Theory (very advanced, but interesting):

Study how groups can act on vector spaces, implement small examples.



4. Basic Algebraic Number Theory:

Think about the ring of integers in quadratic fields, factorization, etc.




Use these two weeks to get a taste of a specialized subject. You’ll likely only scratch the surface.

Weeks 11–12: Integration & Small Projects

Combine concepts in projects that tie multiple ideas together.

Some potential project ideas:

1. Symbolic Algebra Library: Basic symbolic manipulation of polynomials with ring or field coefficients.


2. Group Action Visualizer: If you can show permutations acting on sets or geometry, that’s a nice, self-contained project.


3. Finite Field Cryptography: Build a tiny “toy” version of an elliptic-curve or RSA-like approach (mod n) to see how advanced math underpins cryptography.


4. Polynomial Factorization: Implement algorithms for factoring polynomials in GF(p)[x].




Use your daily hour to push the code forward, test thoroughly, and document your library. Focus on how you might extend or refactor your code to be more modular.

Tips for Success

1. Don’t Skip Theory: Even if it’s only 10 minutes a day, read carefully. Abstract algebra is proof-heavy and conceptual. The code will make more sense if you understand the theorems behind it.


2. Write Tests: For every structure you code (Group, Ring, Field, etc.), write test cases. Verify closure, identity, inverses, etc. This not only cements your understanding but ensures correctness.


3. Refactor Regularly: As you move from groups to rings to fields, you’ll find you can unify certain interfaces (e.g., binary operations, identity elements). Refactoring your library to be more general is a great exercise in both algebraic thinking and software design.


4. Use Version Control: Keep track of your progress in Git. It’ll help keep your experiments organized.


5. Read & Watch: Supplement your daily reading with short lecture videos or open-source math resources (e.g., MIT OpenCourseWare for abstract algebra). Seeing multiple angles helps.


6. Keep a Notebook: Jot down the definitions, theorems, and proof sketches. Even if you do everything in code, mathematical clarity comes from succinct note-taking.

Final Note

If you stick to one hour every day and actively code each concept—building your own data structures, verifying group axioms, constructing fields, etc.—you’ll solidify your abstract algebra understanding in a way that’s far more tangible than pure pencil-and-paper. The key is consistency. Each day, build or test something that demonstrates the core algebraic concept, and you’ll see steady progress over a few months.

Good luck, and have fun building your math library from the ground up!
